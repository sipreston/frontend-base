# Frontend Base Framework

A project allowing developers to get up and running, making HTML pages quickly.
It includes Bootstrap, SASS and Gulp ready to go.

## Get going

CD to the project root and install Node package manager 

``
$ npm install
``

Then fire up gulp, which will automatically start a web server and watch for file changes

``
$ ./node_modules/.bin/gulp 
``

Any changes you make in the resources folder will automatically build in to the 'static' folder. Browser tabs will reload automatically.
